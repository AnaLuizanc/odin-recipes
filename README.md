# odin-recipes
[The Odin Project's first project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).
Here, I will create my first web project in HTML. I will demonstrate the following skills:
- how to add text and images to websites
- how to add ordered and unordered lists
- how to change image size
- how to reference other pages
